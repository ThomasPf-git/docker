# Docker Mysql Container

1. Clone Github Repository to a location which isn't your Downloads Folder

2. Run ```.\1_create_docker_volumes.cmd```

3. Run ```.\2_create_containers.cmd``` to create the containers

4. use the various start and stop scripts for starting and stopping the services

(the del_all_img_docker.ps1 does just that -- you probably won't need it)
